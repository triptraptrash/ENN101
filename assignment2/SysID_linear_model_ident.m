%% 1 - Model definition and data generation
% In this exercise we will work with the ARX defined as 
% y(t) = 0.5*y(t-1) + u(t-1) + e(t)
% Note: e(t) is process noise! 

% True value of the parameters:
atrue = 0.5;
btrue = 1;

% We will work with simulated data, hence let's generate the data:
% (For a real SysID problem, data are not simulated but they are real, there is no model generating them, they come from the true system)
N = 1000; % number of data we want to generate

% Input: we will use a Gaussian signal as input:
u = randn(N,1); % white noise, std = 1
% Output: let's compute the output of the model 
y = zeros(N,1); % noise free
yn = zeros(N,1); % noisy (including e)
% noise
noise_std = 0.1;
e = noise_std * randn(N, 1);
for t = 2:N % zero initial condition
    y(t) = atrue*y(t-1) + btrue*u(t-1);
    yn(t) = atrue*yn(t-1) + btrue*u(t-1)+ e(t);
end

% Let's plot the data (1 output realization)
figure(1); clf;
subplot(2,1,1)
plot(u)

%% 2 - Identification using Least-Squares formula

% Now we do some identification!
% First of all let's split the data in estimation and validation sets
% (half and half)
uest = u(1:N/2);
yest = yn(1:N/2);
uval = u(N/2+1:end);
yval = yn(N/2+1:end);

% As model for identification we will use the 1-step-ahead predictor of
% ARX, which, as we know, is linear in the parameters.
% Hence, first let's write this predictor as a linear regression, in the
% form: y(t) = phi(t)*Theta
% where Theta is the parameter vector and phi(t) the regression vector.

%phi =[y(t-1) ; u(t-1)]
%theta = [a; b]

% Now that we have the predictor in the y(t) = phi(t)*Theta form, we can
% derive the vector form as well: Y = H*Theta, where, now Y is a vector and
% H is matrix.

% Let's build the matrix H:
H = zeros(N/2,2); % The matrix has N/2 rows (time instants), 2 columns (2 parameters)
H(1,:) = [0 0]; % Initial value
for i=2:N/2
    H(i,:) = [yest(i-1) uest(i-1)];
end

% This vector form of the predictor is useful for deriving the least
% squares estimate of Theta

%theta_hat_n = inv(1/N* sum(phi(i)phi(i).')*1/N* sum(phi(i)y(i))
%=inv(H.'*H)*H.'*y <---USE THIS
%=
% Write the expression in code as well, so we get our estimate!

% th = ...
th = (H.'*H)\H.'*yest; %<---- use \ as inv always in this course

% th should be be a vector with two elements, estimated value for a and
% estimate value for b. Let's pick this two elements separetely:
ahat = th(1)
bhat = th(2)


%% 3 - Prediction
% Let's now use the model we found to predict the output!
% Using validation data (or estimation data, just for a check)

NN = N/2;
% Let's redefine the data variables so it will be easy to switch from
% validation to estimation sets.
yn = yval;
un = uval;
% yn = yest; 
% un  = uest;

% Let's do prediction first, write your code for 1-step-ahead predictor
ypred = zeros(NN,1); % that's the vector where we will store the predicted output
ypred(1) = yn(1); % initial output is known
%pred: use y for y hat
%sim: from y use yhat 
%RSME - 1/N*Sum((y(i)-y_hat(i))^2
for i=2:NN
    ypred(i) = ahat*yn(i-1) + bhat*un(i-1);
end

% Once we have the predicted output we can compute the least-squares error with the true data
predERROR = yn-ypred;
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%% Write your code here %%%%%%%%%%%%%

predRMSE  = rms(predERROR);

%% 4 - Simulation
ysim = zeros(NN,1); % that's the vector where we will store the simulated output
ysim(1) = yn(1); % initial output is known
% Write the code for simulation
for i=2:NN 
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    % ysim(i) = ...

    ysim(i)= ahat*ysim(i-1) + bhat*un(i-1);
end
